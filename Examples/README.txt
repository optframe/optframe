OptFrame Examples

This folder is organized in three main sections:
- Legacy: older examples, typically from OptFrame v1, that may require some fixes to work again
- LTS: supported examples, supporting both C++17 and C++20
- Modern: newer examples, assuming newer features like C++ Concepts, Coroutines and also prepared for CXX Modules
