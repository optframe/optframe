========================
MapReduce++v2.0 examples
------------------------

To compile just type "make".

Type "./program" to run a non-MPI example program (SeqEx01, SeqEx02, SeqWordCounter, MapMPEx01, MapMPEx02, or MapMPWordCounter) or type "mpirun -np P program" to run a MPI-based example program (MaPIEx01, MaPIEx02, MaPIWordCounter, MaPIFSEx01, MaPIFSEx02, or MaPIFSEx03), where P is the desired number of MPI processes (in this case P must to be grater than one).

The examples are about three MapReduce implementations of MapReduce++v2.0: SeqMR, MapMP and MaPI. 
SeqMR is a sequential MapReduce implementation. 
MapMP is a parallel shared-memory, e.g. non-distributed, MapReduce implementation based on OpenMP. 
MaPI is a parallel distributed MapReduce implementation based on MPI.

Our suggestion for beginning users is to see first the SeqMR examples and after the MapMP and MaPI examples.
